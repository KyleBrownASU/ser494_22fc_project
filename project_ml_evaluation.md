## Evaluation Metrics
### Metric 1
**Name:** Mean squred error

**Choice Justification:** I chose this metric because it is simplest and most commen method for understanding the relative accury in the model
    This metric also allows me to know if there is actally any correlation between the input data and the output data 

Interpretation:** My mean sqaured error was 553 which i think is pretty good it shows that there is a correlation and my mean error was only actually about 25 cases of violent crimes

### Metric 2
**Name:** r2/accuracy 

**Choice Justification:** I choose this beacuse it measures the model itself by showing the quailty of the model

Interpretation:** my r2 was .86. some sources say that a score if .90 can be really good and i am only .04 of from that.
