    We want to understand which of these factors has an effect on crime rates so corrective action can initaited. 
Intellectual Merit: 
    With this data we can understand how to advance learning and create better access to education for all by making campus safer. 
Data Sourcing: 
    This projects methodology will be to source data from publicly availble federal sources such as the census and FBI/DOJ puplic records. Then we will look for corealations and then determind if those corealations are valid

Resarch questions

R01: Visualise the connection between crime and other soical econimc factors. 

R02 : Determine if we can predict the Danger of a campus based on several factors. 

RO3: To defend the model for performing the prediction in RO2.

R04: Evaulate the relationships defined in the model.
