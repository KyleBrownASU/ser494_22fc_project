# Introduction
This repository contains files for the individual course project in SER 494: Data Science for Software Engineers (fall 2022) created by Kyle Brown for partial fulfillment of the course requirements.

At this time, this project has not been cleared by the course staff (R. Acuna, V. Gupta) for public release, and must be kept within a private repository.
