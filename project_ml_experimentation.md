## Explainable Records
### Record 1
**Raw Data:** [2019,30414,149] output was 19.48717727 expected was 14

Prediction Explanation:** This record means that in 2019 there was a school with 30500 students and 149 property crimes reported to the fbi.
    I predicted the number of violent crimes that year to be 19.5 and the actuall was 14 violent crimes
    This means that either my model is either just a bit of or for some reason this school under reports their violent crimes more that there property crimes.

### Record 2
**Raw Data:** [2006,187477,2687] output was 78.58852103 and the expected was 110

Prediction Explanation:** This record means that in 2006 there was a school has 187,477 students and 2700 property crimes reported to the fbi
    I predicted the number of violent crimes that year to be 78.58852103 and the actuall was 110 violent crimes.
    This means that my either my model is wrong or there is some reason this school is severaly  undereporting the violent crimes as oppsed to the property crimes. 

## Interesting Features
### Feature A
**Feature:** I found that my model tends to under estimate violent crime rates as opposed to over estimate. 

**Justification:** This suggests that there is somethin wron with the way my model is built but i cant figure it out 

### Feature B
**Feature:** I found that rate of increse of violent crime on campus tends to be corelated with the rate of the poputaion growth 

**Justification:** This suggests that overall conditions at the schools do not change. 

## Experiments 
### Varying A
**Prediction Trend Seen:** I found that when i varied the year that there was no decernable diffrence indicating that campus as whole are not geeting more danguerous 

### Varying B
**Prediction Trend Seen:** I found that as a campus grows the diffrence between the expected and actal output grows. This could mean that bigger schools are less predicatble or that i have fewer data points representing large schools

### Varying A and B together
**Prediction Trend Seen:** TODO


### Varying A and B inversely
**Prediction Trend Seen:** TODO

I was not able to do these
